# Aliases and Binds

## Why use aliases/binds

- Faster manual control.
- Safer stop/recovery controls.
- Standardized team commands.

## Alias patterns

- Keep alias names short and obvious.
- Include purpose in comments when stored in files.
- Avoid overloading one alias with many side effects.

## Bind patterns

- Reserve one emergency stop key.
- Separate movement/utility/combat binds by key region.
- Avoid conflicts with native game bindings.

## Example checklist

- [ ] Stop all automation bind
- [ ] Pause/resume bind
- [ ] Assist/target bind
- [ ] Follow/anchor bind
- [ ] Recovery (sit, clear target, stop movement)
