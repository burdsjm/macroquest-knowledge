## Triage checklist

1. Confirm MQ version and game client compatibility.
2. Reproduce issue with minimal plugin set.
3. Capture logs/output and exact commands.
4. Isolate whether issue is macro, plugin, or environment.

## Common issue buckets

- Macro stops unexpectedly.
- Commands not recognized.
- Plugin load failures.
- Targeting/navigation desync.
- Performance spikes during heavy loops.

## Debug habits

- Add temporary log lines around decision points.
- Reduce loop speed only as needed for diagnosis.
- Disable non-essential automation while testing.

## Escalation template

- Version/build:
- Active plugins:
- Repro steps:
- Expected vs actual:
- Logs/snippets:
