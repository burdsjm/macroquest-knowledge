# Getting Started

This page is a practical onboarding guide based on official MacroQuest documentation.

## Install

1. Review official install instructions at docs.macroquest.org.
2. Install the current MacroQuest build compatible with your EverQuest client/server.
3. Launch EverQuest and attach/start MacroQuest as documented.

## First run checklist

- Verify MacroQuest loads successfully.
- Open in-game command input and run a simple MQ command.
- Confirm base plugins you need are loaded.
- Save profile/config if required by your workflow.

## Safety notes

- Read the rules for your server and account policy before automation.
- Start with minimal automation and monitor behavior.
- Avoid unattended gameplay where disallowed.
- Keep scripts conservative (timeouts, escape conditions, and stop binds).

## Terminology

- **TLO**: Top-level object used in expressions (for example, `${Me}` style references).
- **Macro**: Script in the MacroQuest macro language.
- **Alias**: Command shorthand.
- **Bind**: Key mapping to MQ command(s).
- **Plugin**: Loadable module extending MQ behavior.
